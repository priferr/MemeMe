# MemeMe
* App for iOS Udacity course

# Tech Used
* Xcode 13.4.1
* Swift 5
* iOS 15.5
* Simulator iPhone 11

# Instructions
* Open the App;
* User click on Photo Album button or camera buttons;
* It chooses a picture;
* Writes on top and/or bottom of it to make it a meme;
* It can click on Share button to share it through Activity Controller or click on Cancel button, to return to first screen.

# Notes
* The meme is created by saving the original picture with the texts - top and bottom. Through share button, the meme can be saved in the phone. 
* Apparently the SourceType .photolibrary is becoming depracated in near future, the new class is 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑃𝐻𝑃ℎ𝑜𝑡𝑜𝐿𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑟𝑦 : 𝑁𝑆𝑂𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡 - but I didn't managed to implement it, so I followed the course .photoLibrary source.
